    <h4>A version-control system is essentially a backup system for related collections of files. <br>
       The main functionality that Gitlet supports is:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Saving the contents of entire directories of files, also called committing, and the saved contents themselves are called commits.</li>
      <li>Restoring a version of one or more files or entire commits. In Gitlet, this is called checking out those files or that commit.</li>
      <li>Viewing the history of your backups. In Gitlet, you view this history in something called the log.</li>
      <li>Maintaining related sequences of commits, called branches.</li>
      <li>Merging changes made in one branch into another.</li>
    </ol>
